# Snippets App
A node.js restful API for storing code snippets.
Each snippet entry requires a "text" field that is the actual code to be stored. The field felt it should be something like "code" but I fear the name may cause interference or confusion in the long run.
A "language" field is also required. It specifies for which programming language the snippet is applicable. And a "description" (also required) describes what the snippet does.
